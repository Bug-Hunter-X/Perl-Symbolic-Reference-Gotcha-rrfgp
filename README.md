# Perl Symbolic Reference Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Perl's symbolic references.  Symbolic references, while powerful, can be tricky to understand and lead to unexpected behavior if misused.

The `bug.pl` file contains code that showcases this issue. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a solution and demonstrates best practices for avoiding this type of error. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

The use of `$$ref` directly modifies the value of `$var`, potentially leading to confusion or unintended consequences when debugging or maintaining the code.

**Solution:**

The `bugSolution.pl` file provides safer and more readable ways to work with references. It's generally recommended to avoid symbolic references unless absolutely necessary for advanced metaprogramming.
